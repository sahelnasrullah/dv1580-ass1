# Programming-In-C

#Introduction
In this assignment, you will develop a custom memory manager that handles dynamic memory allocation, which you will then use to implement a single linked list. This foundational project will help you understand memory management concepts in C.

#Description
You are to create a memory manager that can efficiently allocate, deallocate, and resize memory blocks. Afterwards, you would use this memory manager to implement a linked list that manages its elements using your custom memory functions.
